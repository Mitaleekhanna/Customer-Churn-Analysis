# Customer-Churn-Analysis

Data Understanding, Cleaning, and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

In this customer churn analysis project, our initial focus is on understanding, cleaning, and conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the available dataset. This phase lays the foundation for identifying patterns and insights related to customer churn.

Data Understanding: We begin by thoroughly examining the dataset, gaining an understanding of its structure, and documenting its variables. This step involves understanding the meaning of each data field, its type (categorical or numerical), and its relevance to the analysis. It also includes checking for data sources, data collection methods, and any potential issues related to data quality and completeness.

Data Cleaning: In the data cleaning phase, we address data quality issues, such as missing values. This involves techniques like removing missing data and handling any duplicate records. Clean and reliable data is essential for accurate analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): With clean data in hand, we embark on EDA to uncover valuable insights. EDA involves generating summary statistics, visualizations, and charts to explore the distribution of variables, correlations, and trends within the data. We aim to answer key questions such as:

What is the distribution of customer churn within the dataset?
Which age group is highest churners?
Which medium are highest churners?
What are the most influential factors contributing to churn?

EDA not only helps us gain a deeper understanding of the data but also guides us in formulating hypotheses for subsequent analysis. It can reveal initial patterns that may inform feature engineering and model selection for predicting and mitigating customer churn.
